A Mutating webhook is made up of Mutator interface.\nMutating webhooks are with admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1/MutatingWebhookConfiguration Kubernetes resource\nA Mutator can act also as a mutator chain, Check mutating.Chain HTTP Handler Kubewebhook focuses on the Kubernetes webhooks itself, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to manage the http server, that\u0026rsquo;s why it will provide a Go http.Handler and you can set this handler on the http.Server that you want with the options.\nThis approach makes gives the user the flexibility to serve the webhook in very customized ways like number of connections, address, paths\u0026hellip;\nTo get a Handler from a previous created Webhook you can use http.HandlerFor method.\nYou can create a single HTTP server with multiple webhooks (multiple hadlers) "
